    <h1>pydsm</h1>
    <p><i>pydsm</i> is a Python tool for exact computation of seismic waveforms in spherically symmetric (1-D)
      transversely isotropic (TI) media using the direct solution methods (DSM). <i>pydsm</i> is based on the Fortran codes of the DSM
       (kawai et al., 2006) compiled into a python library (using numpy.f2py).
    </p>

    <h2>pytomo</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/afeborgeaud/pytomo">pytomo</a> is a Python tool for seismic tomography based on <i>pydsm</i>.
      <i>pydsm</i> can compute several seismic models in parallel, which is used in <i>pytomo</i> to run probabilistic waveform inversion
      with a neighbourhood algorithm (Sambridge, 1999).

    <p>The video below show an example of synthetic inversion with a neighbourhood algorithm for the
      depth and shear-velocity jump in the D'' layer at the bottom of the Earth's mantle
      (left: voronoi cells colored by waveform variance; middle: target, and best inverted model for the current iteration; right: waveforms for the target, and current best inverted model)
